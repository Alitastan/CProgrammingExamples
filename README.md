# CProgrammingExamples
This repository contains examples and programming projects from the [C Programming - A Modern Approach / K. N. KING](http://knking.com/books/c2/cover.html)


## Notes

There are few examples and programming projects which has solutions on the book whereas most of them do not have any solution. You can find my solutions for each section. I hope you enjoy!



### Some of my favorite programs:
- [sevensegment.c](https://github.com/Alitastan/CProgrammingExamples/blob/main/10ProgramOrganization/ProgrammingProjects/sevensegment.c) 
 *that displays the input digits with a simulated seven-segment effect.*
- [RPNcalculator.c](https://github.com/Alitastan/CProgrammingExamples/blob/main/10ProgramOrganization/ProgrammingProjects/RPNcalculator.c) *which demonstrates the use of a stack ``(stacks are an abstract concept, not a C feature; they can be implemented in most programming languages.) `` and Reverse Polish Notation which some calculators use. This is a good example to understand how the stack pop and push operations actually work.*
- [BIFF.c](https://github.com/Alitastan/CProgrammingExamples/blob/main/8Arrays/ProgrammingProjects/BIFF.c) *program that transforms your input characters to BIFF speak mode. Like H3Y DUD3 C 15 R1LLY C00L!!!!!!!*
- [randomwalk.c](https://github.com/Alitastan/CProgrammingExamples/blob/main/9Functions/ProgrammingProjects/randomwalk2.c) *program that walks on a 10 x 10 array and printing ASCII letters on it.*
- [magicsquare.c](https://github.com/Alitastan/CProgrammingExamples/blob/main/9Functions/ProgrammingProjects/magicsquare2.c) *program which creates a so called magic square of specified size. I was not aware of this phenomenon before. It is really elegant!*
- [reversesentence.c](https://github.com/Alitastan/CProgrammingExamples/blob/main/8Arrays/ProgrammingProjects/reversesentence.c) *program which takes your input question then reverse it. Working with characters are sometimes very troublesome! check* [namesurname.c](https://github.com/Alitastan/CProgrammingExamples/blob/main/8Arrays/ProgrammingProjects/reversesentence.c)
- [newton.c](https://github.com/Alitastan/CProgrammingExamples/blob/main/7BasicTypes/ProgrammingProjects/newton.c) *this program computes a positive numbers square root with Newton's method. I did not know about this technique before.*
